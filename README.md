## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Color picker
- As some of the colours are not listed in style guide, I had to look for the colour myself. I used an online colour picker: https://imagecolorpicker.com/. But I wonder if there is more convenient tool which can pick colour just on screen instead of uploading the image.

CSS Flexbox
- In the challenge, I strengthed my knowledge of Flexbox, especially when working on the Annual Plan Box which has elements in both row and column together.

Mobile view
- It was my first time working on mobile view. I found that a organised css global setting is very important which can simplified the mobile css rules.


Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
